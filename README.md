# Intro to Git

This project is intended to present an overview of git to the biostatistics
department at UCD and anyone else who wants to attend.

The presentation will be based on the Pro Git Book 2, a summary of the first
three chapters.  Introduction to Git, a "Why use git" will start the
presentation and is inspired by a presentation given by Hadley Wickham.
